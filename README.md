# MAGiC 2024 - PHP Workshop

Welcome to the PHP workshop!

Follow along by completing the following sections.  
Each section will be contained in it's own folder (i.e. Section 1 Setup is in the folder `1_Setup`).  
There's a README.md file in each folder with instructions for that section.  
‚ùó The sections will build on each other, so go in order.  

### 1. Setup  
This section will set up the initial file structure and ensure that we can connect.  

### 2. Routes and URLs  
This section will look at how routing and URLs work.
